README.txt - Description of files included in folder

decision_tree.py - Recursive decision tree algorithm that I wrote with a classmate. Specifically, given the filenames for the training dataset and testing dataset, the main function (go) will use the training dataset to build the decision tree, apply that decision tree to the testing dataset, and output the predictions as a list.

hash_table.py - Basic implementation of a hash table using Python classes.

markov.py - Uses the HashTable class from hash_table.py to construct a k-th order Markov model to analyze actual text and assess the likelihood that a particular person uttered that text.

network_structure.py - Graph architecture function that I wrote for a group project analyzing political party-switching in the Peruvian political system. The function validates inputed SQL queries to ensure that the data is structure appropriately for analysis and then constructs a networkx Graph object using the edge and node data.
